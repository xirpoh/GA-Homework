#Homework H1
Find the minimum for the following functions: De Jong 1, Schwefel's, Rastrigin's, Michalewicz's
using the Hill Climbing (the first improvement, best improvement and worst improvement variants) and Simulated Annealing algorithms (hybridising one of the Hill Climbing variants).
Analyse the 5-, 10- and 30-dimensional versions of all functions. (Perhaps run the 100-dimensional version as well, as an upper bound). Use a precision of at least 5 decimal places after 0. 

#Homework H2
Solve Homework T1 using a Genetic Algorithm. Compare with the results obtained in Homework H1 and offer explanations.

#Homework H2'
Optimise the Genetic Algorithm used for Homework H2 by adding adaptive parameters, adaptive operators, Gray coding, etc.

#Homework H3
Solve one of the problems below with a Genetic Algorithm and another heuristic:
1. The Quadratic Assignment Problem
2. The Graph Colouring Problem
3. The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)
4. The Logical Satisfiability Problem (SAT)
Use only instances from instance libraries (don't generate your own test instances). 
Use at least 10 instances, with 3 of them the largest and most difficult available.
